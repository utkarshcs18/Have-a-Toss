# Have-a-Toss
🪙 Coin Flip Game (Heads or Tails)

A simple Heads or Tails (Coin Flip) game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is one of my early frontend learning projects — made to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.

🎮 Features

Click a button to flip a coin 🎲

Randomly shows Heads or Tails

Keeps track of your Wins and Losses

Includes a Reset button to start fresh

Fully responsive and built using only vanilla JS

🧠 What I Learned

Handling user events in JavaScript (addEventListener)

Updating the DOM dynamically using .innerHTML

Working with functions, parameters, and conditional logic

Basic HTML/CSS structuring and styling

Managing small project files and version control with Git

The extra/ folder (or any unrelated files) includes test and practice files I created while learning HTML, CSS, and JS.
They might not be part of the final game, but I kept them for reference.
